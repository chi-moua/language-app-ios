### What kind of change does this PR Introduce (Bug, fix, feature, docs, update, etc ...) ?

### What is the current behavior (or link to issue)?

### What is the new behavior?

----

Pre-review checklist
- [ ] PR title follows `<type>:<description>` convention
- [ ] Add screenshots if needed
- [ ] **Squash commits** following commit guidelines. (This can be done before making the PR. Commits can also be squashed when "merging" PRs. However, instead of "merge" choose "squash" and follow the guidelines for commit syntax.)

### PR Titles / Commit Guidelines
Create PRs with **PR titles** and **Squshed commits** following this format:

    <type>[optional scope]: <description>

For `<type>` favor one of:
- `build` relating to CI/CD build scripts & tools
- `chore` for tasks unrelated to other categories
- `conf` for configuration changes
- `docs` for documentation only changes
- `feat` for features
- `fix` for bug fixes
- `init` when adding/configurating packages/tools
- `test` when adding/correcting existing tests
